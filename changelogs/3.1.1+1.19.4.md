# YetAnotherConfigLib v3.1.1 for 1.20.1

## Rewrote gui-scope `ImageRenderer` API

The `ImageRenderer` API has been rewritten internally to use a dual-thread
initialization. Before, GL calls were made on a separate thread, which silently
threw errors. Sodium 0.5 introduced an option called `No Error Context`, which turned
these warnings into complete JVM crashes.

Because of this, this rewrite was unavailable.

In the process of a huge YACL update, this commit was buried under a lot more changes
that are not ready for production yet, so I decided to branch from 3.1.0 and cherrypick
this commit to fix the issue.

## Does it affect me as a developer?

Most likely not, declaring images through `OptionDescription.Builder` is unaffected as that
is part of the safe API. However, if you use the `ImageRenderer` directly to create your own
custom renderers, you will have to update your code to use the new API.

## Does it affect me as a user?

Most likely, yes. Zoomify and a few other popular mods use the `ImageRenderer` API directly,
these mods will need updating, and will fail to load the images or even crash if they are not updated.
