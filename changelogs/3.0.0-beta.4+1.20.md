# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.0 Beta 4

## Additions

- Added `OptionDescription.Builder.customImage()` to add your own renderer for the option description.

## API Changes

This release brings a few API breakages, getting them out the way, as it is a major update.

- All controllers now have an API builder for creating them. This is to make it easier to add
  more options to them in the future. This also creates a new API layer to remove simple implementations of YACL
  from using the GUI package. The old constructors are still available and you can pass your own controller
  with `.customController()`. An example would be `.controller(TickBoxControllerBuilder::create)` or:
  ```java
  .controller(opt -> IntegerSliderControllerBuilder.create(opt)
          .range(0, 10)
          .step(1))
  ```
- Completely removed `.tooltip()` from groups and options. You should use `.description()` instead.
  To make this a little easier, `OptionDescription.of(Component...)` has been added so you don't need to
  create a builder.
- Removed `OptionDescription.Builder.name(Component)` as it now just uses the option name.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed option descriptions being stuck on the last clicked option when not hovering.
- Fixed category tooltips not being displayed with the new tabs.
